# ReactJS Template
ReactJS Template is a skeleton project for React web application.<br />
You can manually configure Webpack & Babel for your ReactJS project.

## Recommended Dependencies
- react-redux<br />
Redux is a library for managing application state. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments, and are easy to test. Find more information at here: https://redux.js.org/ You can add Redux to your project by executing
```
npm install --save react react-redux
```
- react-router-dom<br />
This template is designed for single page web application. Therefore, the template does not include react-router-dom by default. If you would like to develop multi-page web application, add this dependency by running
```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
- axios<br />
Most likely you would want to make http requests. There are many node packages for it. I would recommend to use axios.
```
npm install --save axios
```
- Material UI for React<br />
This package provides many nice pre-built React components that are designed based on Google's Material UI. Go to the link below for more information about its installation and usage.
